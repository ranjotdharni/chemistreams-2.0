# ChemiStreams 2.0
Browser-based chat application. This is a remake of a plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript chat application called ChemiStreams that I made years ago. ChemiStreams was the first web application I made at the start of my career as a web developer. I'm confident that at this point, I can do much better.

## To Do
- [x] UI
- [ ] Firebase Realtime
- [ ] Google, Github Auth Providers
- [ ] Refresh Token (possibly)
- [ ] Media Files
- [ ] Database Rules
- [ ] Responsive Design
- [ ] API
- [ ] Synchronize users in auth w/ realtime (sign up + sign in)
- [ ] Email validation (client sign up + confirmation)
