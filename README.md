UPDATE GITHUB OAUTH CLIENT WHEN DEPLOYING!!!!!!

# ChemiStreams 2.0
Browser-based chat application. This is a remake of a plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript chat application called ChemiStreams that I made years ago. ChemiStreams was the first web application I made at the start of my career as a web developer. I'm confident that at this point, I can do much better.

## To Do

### Functional
- [x] UI
- [x] Firebase Realtime
- [x] Google, Github Auth Providers
- [x] Media Files
- [x] Edit Profile
- [x] Change Theme
- [x] Responsive Design
- [x] Database Rules
- [ ] Documentation

### Non-functional
- [ ] Migrate to Cloudinary Cluster
- [ ] Add/Remove/Kick after creation
- [ ] Block List
- [ ] OEmbed Links
- [ ] Pagination
- [ ] API
- [ ] Synchronize users in auth w/ realtime (sign up + sign in)
- [ ] Email validation (client sign up + confirmation)

## Notes
- Users can only be added/removed from group chat; all direct chats can only have messages w/ ${message_type} = 0
